My name is John (A1)

Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is John Smith. I am 19 and a student in college. I go to college in New
York. My favorite courses are Geometry, French, and History. English is my hardest course. My
professors are very friendly and smart. It's my second year in college now. I love it!

students. Their names are Bill, Tony, and Paul. We help each other with homework. On the weekend,
we play football together.

I have a younger brother. He just started high school. He is 14 and lives with my parents. They live on
Mulberry Street in Boston. Sometimes they visit me in New York. I am happy when they visit. My Mom
always brings me sweets and candy when they come. I really miss them, too!

Our Vacation (A1)

Every year we go to Florida. We like to go to the beach.
My favorite beach is called Emerson Beach. It is very long, with soft sand and palm trees. It is very
beautiful. I like to make sandcastles and watch the sailboats go by. Sometimes there are dolphins and
whales in the water!
Every morning we look for shells in the sand. I found fifteen big shells last year. I put them in a special
place in my room. This year I want to learn to surf. It is hard to surf, but so much fun! My sister is a
good surfer. She says that she can teach me. I hope I can do it!
